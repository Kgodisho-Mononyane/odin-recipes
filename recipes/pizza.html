    <p>Pizza is a popular and versatile dish that originated in Italy, consisting of a 
        flat, round base of dough baked with a variety of toppings. It is traditionally 
        cooked in a wood-fired oven, resulting in a crispy crust.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 can (15 ounces/425 grams) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 can (6 ounces/170 grams) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 package (6 ounces/170 grams) sliced pepperoni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced black olives (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced bell peppers (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced red onions (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano (for sprinkling on top)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together and is no longer sticky.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the tomato sauce, tomato paste, minced garlic, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
            <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions (one portion for each pizza).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) circle.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the prepared pizza sauce evenly over each dough circle.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce on each pizza.</li>
            <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices evenly on top of the cheese. Add any optional toppings (black olives, bell peppers, red onions) if desired.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese over each pizza.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a pinch of dried oregano on top of each pizza for added flavor.</li>
            <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. If using a baking sheet, place it directly in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the pizza hot.</li>
        </ol>
