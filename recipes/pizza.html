    <p>Pizza is a popular and versatile dish that originated in Italy, consisting of a 
        flat, round base of dough baked with a variety of toppings. It is traditionally 
        cooked in a wood-fired oven, resulting in a crispy crust.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F/45째C)
3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
For the Pizza Sauce:
1 can (15 ounces/425 grams) tomato sauce
1 can (6 ounces/170 grams) tomato paste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon sugar
Salt and pepper to taste
For the Toppings:
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 package (6 ounces/170 grams) sliced pepperoni
1/4 cup sliced black olives (optional)
1/4 cup sliced bell peppers (optional)
1/4 cup sliced red onions (optional)

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
Add olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine.
Gradually add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together and is no longer sticky.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
Prepare the Sauce:

In a medium bowl, combine the tomato sauce, tomato paste, minced garlic, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.
Assemble the Pizza:

Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.
Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions (one portion for each pizza).
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion of dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) circle.
Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Spread half of the prepared pizza sauce evenly over each dough circle.
Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce on each pizza.
Arrange the pepperoni slices evenly on top of the cheese. Add any optional toppings (black olives, bell peppers, red onions) if desired.
Sprinkle 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese over each pizza.
Sprinkle a pinch of dried oregano on top of each pizza for added flavor.
Bake the Pizza:

If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. If using a baking sheet, place it directly in the oven.
Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.
Serve:

Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
Slice and serve the pizza hot.
