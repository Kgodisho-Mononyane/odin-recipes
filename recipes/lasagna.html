        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of 
        stacked layers of pasta alternated with fillings such 
        as rag√π (a meat sauce), vegetables, cheese (such as 
        ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano), and 
        various seasonings and spices. The dish is baked in 
        an oven, often resulting in a crispy top layer of 
        cheese and a hearty, comforting meal.</p>
