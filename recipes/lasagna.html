    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of 
        stacked layers of pasta alternated with fillings such 
        as ragù (a meat sauce), vegetables, cheese (such as 
        ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano), and 
        various seasonings and spices. The dish is baked in 
        an oven, often resulting in a crispy top layer of 
        cheese and a hearty, comforting meal.</p>

                Add chopped onions and cook until they are translucent.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef (and ground pork if using) to the skillet.

            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and red wine (if using).</li>
            <li>Add chopped basil, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil,

            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, shredded 
                mozzarella cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients 
                are thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment paper or a clean kitchen 
                towel to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x9 inch (23x23 cm) baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place 2 lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
            <li>Spread one-third of the cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
            <li>Spread one-third of the meat sauce over the cheese layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese over the top layer of meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
