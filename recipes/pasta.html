    <p>Pasta is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, typically made from an 
        unleavened dough of durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into
        various shapes and sizes. It is cooked by boiling or baking and can be served with 
        a variety of sauces, meats, and vegetables.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            1 pound (450 grams) ground beef (or a mixture of ground beef and ground pork)
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 can (14.5 ounces/410 grams) crushed tomatoes
1 can (15 ounces/425 grams) tomato sauce
1 can (6 ounces/170 grams) tomato paste
1/4 cup (60 ml) red wine (optional)
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
For the Pasta:
12 ounces (340 grams) pasta (such as spaghetti, penne, or your preferred type)
Salt for boiling water
For Serving:
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Fresh basil or parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)

            <li></li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Add ground beef (or beef and pork mixture) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.
Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and red wine (if using).
Add sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.
Cook the Pasta:

While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
Drain the pasta and set aside.
Combine and Serve:

Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the meat sauce. Toss to combine until the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.
Serve the pasta in bowls or on plates. Top with grated Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.
