    <p>Pasta is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, typically made from an 
        unleavened dough of durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into

        a variety of sauces, meats, and vegetables.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef (or beef and pork mixture) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and red wine (if using).</li>
            <li>Add sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the meat sauce. Toss to combine until the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta in bowls or on plates. Top with grated Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
